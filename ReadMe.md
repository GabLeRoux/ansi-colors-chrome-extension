# ANSI Colors chrome extension

Chrome extension that converts ANSI characters to colors on the fly / on button click for the lazy ones. Does what [ansi-html-stream][ansi-html-stream] does but within browser.

*Work in progress* (pressing on button currently strip ansi characters for now) :P

## Motivation

I once used to run [salt](https://saltstack.com/) commands with [jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), which outputs colored data by default, but it gets unreadable in a webpage! There's a [jenkins plugin for this](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin), but I tought **why not a plugin for chrome itself?** Here it is :)

Here's a related blog post I wrote about ansi characters and colors:
[Keep saltstack colored output](https://gableroux.com/tips/2016/02/18/keep-saltstack-colored-output/)

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out how to pass data to [ansi-html-stream][ansi-html-stream] (using a stream? maybe I should find a different solution)
- [x] Provide ansi stripping capability [strip-ansi][strip-ansi]
- [ ] Add support for colors instead of stripping colors
- [ ] Create an icon
- [ ] Publish

## Usage

Right now, hitting extension button can convert from this:
```

to this

## Installation

Until this is deployed to the Chrome web store, right now, you can do this:
1. Clone the repository or hit the download button
2. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Check the Developer mode checkbox
![chrome-extensions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1264761/23734467/40ac4e3a-044d-11e7-8ef6-d5f3a043767a.png)
4. Hit `Load unpacked extension...` button
5. Select the `app` folder where you download the extension (which contains the `manifest.json` file)

Then you're good to go!
