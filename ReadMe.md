# ANSI Colors chrome extension

Chrome extension that converts ANSI characters to colors on the fly / on button click for the lazy ones.

*Work in progress* (pressing on button currently strip ansi characters for now) :P

## What it does

- [x] Provide ansi stripping capability using [chalk/strip-ansi][chalk/strip-ansi]
- [x] Convert ansi to html using [rburns/ansi-to-html][rburns/ansi-to-html]

## Motivation

I used to run [salt](https://saltstack.com/) commands with [jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), which outputs colored data by default, but it's hard to read on a webpage! There's a [jenkins plugin for this](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin), but we can fix this at a higher level so here's a solution: browser extension!

Here's a related blog post I wrote about ansi characters and colors:  
[Keep saltstack colored output](https://gableroux.com/tips/2016/02/18/keep-saltstack-colored-output/)

## Todo

- [ ] Add support for colors instead of stripping colors
- [ ] Create an icon

## Usage

Right now, hitting extension button can convert from this:
```
