# [ANSI Colors chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hpkomngllcnigoocaolicfknnhibnmfi/)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/GabLeRoux/ansi-colors-chrome-extension.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Chrome extension that converts ANSI characters to colors on the fly / on button click for the lazy ones. Does what [ansi-html-stream][ansi-html-stream] does but within browser.

*Work in progress* (pressing on button currently strip ansi characters for now) :P

## Motivation

I once used to run [salt](https://saltstack.com/) commands with [jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), which outputs colored data by default, but it gets unreadable in a webpage! There's a [jenkins plugin for this](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin), but I tought **why not a plugin for chrome itself?** Here it is :)

Here's a related blog post I wrote about ansi characters and colors:
[Keep saltstack colored output](https://gableroux.com/tips/2016/02/18/keep-saltstack-colored-output/)

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out how to pass data to [ansi-html-stream][ansi-html-stream] (using a stream? maybe I should find a different solution) See #1 help needed!
- [ ] Add support for colors instead of stripping colors
- [ ] Create an icon
- [x] Provide ansi stripping capability [strip-ansi][strip-ansi] :tada:
- [x] Publish

## Usage

Right now, hitting extension button can convert from this:
